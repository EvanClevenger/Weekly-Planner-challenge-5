Work Day Scheduler 

This Web app demonstrates the usfulness of API's. This Weekly planner was made possible with moment.js. An API that gives us the present date and time. This is usfull for our schduler to reference the current hour so the time blocks and be colored appopriatly.

And Bootstrap which is a CSS framework. This helps with the styling of the CSS so we can focus on wrting the JS file and not have to worry about desiging the time blocks and buttons.  

With this Scheduler you can save a task and refresh the page, with your custom task saved in the time block that you used. 
These times are chosen to represent the 8 hour work day so this can be used in the office to tackle work tasks throughout the day.
